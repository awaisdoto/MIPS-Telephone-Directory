# MIPS-Telephone-Directory

This is a small practice project developed using **MARS** (MIPS Assembler and Runtime Simulator) to implement a typical **telephone directory**. <br>
The project was built using **MIPS Assembly Language**, which was a great learning experience for me, as it was my first time working with Assembly.<br>
<br>
The project initially inputs data for 6 users. Then there is a home screen function called which gives a user 3 functions: Searching by Name, Editing by ID and Deleting by ID.<br>

<br>
Even though it's not the most complex project out there, I had having fun and that is all that matters
