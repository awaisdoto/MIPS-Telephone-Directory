# MIPS-Telephone-Directory
# A small pracatice project was made on  MARS (MIPS Assembler and Runtime Simulator), which had the logic of a typical telephone directory implemented on it.
# Assembly Language for MIPS architecture was used.
# The project initially inputs data for 6 users. Then there is a home screen function called which gives a user 3 functions: Searching by Name, Editing by ID and Deleting by ID.
# I know this project doesn't seem like too complex for most programmers but for me it was a good learning experience as it was my first time using Assembly. 
# Eventhough I was running it in a simulator, I was happy and that is all that matters :)
